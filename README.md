# Practice for 5511 CNN 
### Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project

*May 2023*



### **Problem Statement**

The main objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can detect cancer in histopathologic scans of lymph nodes. Specifically, the model will be designed to identify metastatic tissues in these scans, which will assist in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in patients. Instead of relying solely on human interpretation of these scans for diagnosis, the model will provide a more accurate and efficient way to detect cancerous tissues, potentially improving patient outcomes.



### **Data Source:**

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data


The data set includes 220025 images for training, each image has a label of 0 or 1 in 'train_labels.csv', and also 57458 test images to be labeled.




### **Methodology**

To classify test images with the right label, we will use cnn. After implementing this approach, we will upload the label of test images to kaggle to see the accuracy.

By completing this project, we hope to enhance our knowledge of cnn and its applicability in real-world scenarios.


### **Detail steps** 


**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 

Firstly we will explore and visualize the data to understand the structure and distribution of the data.  

**2. Model Training & Evaluation**

Next, we will build cnn with training data set and check the performance on test dataset. 

**3. Conclusions**

Finally, we will summarize the results and see what can be improved in the future.
